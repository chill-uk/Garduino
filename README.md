The idea is to create application in parts:

1) Read Moisture level
2) Read Light level
3) Read Weather forecast (Open weather map API)
4) Read Battery level
5) Read Temperature / Humidity Levels

Web stuff:

6) Create web page displaying current environmental details plus a manual water button.
7) Create config web page to input your:
    * wifi/password [CONNECT]
    * Openweathermap API Key [TEST/SAVE]
    * Openweathermap GPS location / City name [TEST/SAVE]
9) Create a historical web page that retrieves the data from a memory location. (Could be difficult).
